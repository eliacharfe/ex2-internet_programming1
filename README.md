<h1>Execution</h1>
<p>
The submission is a WebStorm project that can be run directly from the IDE. <br><br>
 This program open an html page which has a form that builds a to do list according to the <br>
 user's inputs. For adding a new task, the user need to insert a correct title (no other <br>
 characters than letters or numbers and also cannot insert a title that is already un the <br>
 list), a description of the task, a check box that when pressed will classsified the task as a <br>
 high priority task, and press on the add button. The program will display <br>
 automatically the list on the dom. When a task is added it comes with a delete button that <br>
 allows the user to delete the task at anytime he wishes. There is a sort button as well, when <br>
 the user presses on the sort button the list will be sorted by the titles of the tasks. <br>
 Another button is "show high priority" that when pressed will display on the page only <br>
 the high priority tasks and a back button to return to the regular state. <br>
 When an input of the user is incorrect it will show the user a particular message <br>
 telling what is wrong and display where the problem is (of course will not create the task).
